This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-debug, issue in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and weak references.  The `bug.m` file showcases the problematic code, resulting in crashes due to accessing a deallocated object.  The solution in `bugSolution.m` illustrates how to safely handle KVO with weak references to prevent these crashes. The problem arises when an observed object is deallocated before the observer removes itself, leading to undefined behavior and crashes. The solution focuses on ensuring that the observer is always removed before the observed object is deallocated. This is crucial for robust and stable applications.
