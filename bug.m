In Objective-C, a tricky bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management, especially when dealing with weak references. If an observed object is deallocated while an observer is still registered, the KVO mechanism might try to access the deallocated object, leading to a crash.  This is particularly insidious because it might not manifest consistently, depending on the timing of object deallocation and KVO notification.
